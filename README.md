# laser_demoparty_cookie

This repo is for the demo I imagined for and during the Cookie demoparty in Paris (december '17).
The code is based on Sam's work with Etherdreams controllers for lasers, see :
* [his page dedicated to lasers](http://www.neurohack.cc/index.php?title=LaserBootstrap)
* [the bootstrap code for the demoparty on github](https://github.com/tmpbci/Cookie-Paris-2017-Laser-competition-examples)

Documentation is in progress, feel free to ask questions !
